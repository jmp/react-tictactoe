# React tic-tac-toe

Implemented based on https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html to learn the basics of React.

## To Do

 * Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
 * When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
 * When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
